ANSI Control Sequence.

Note: additional commands are documented below.
As these are implemented, the command chars should be added to the cs_re pattern.

CSI n A CUU â€“ Cursor Up Moves the cursor n (default 1) cells in the given direction.
  If the cursor is already at the edge of the screen, this has no effect.

CSI n B: Cursor Down
CSI n C: Cursor Forward
CSI n D: Cursor Back
CSI n E: Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines down.
CSI n F: Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines up.

CSI n G: Moves the cursor to column n.

CSI n S: Scroll whole page up by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the bottom. (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n T: Scroll whole page down by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the top. (not ANSI.SYS)
